This is my first blog post using MDX!

## What is MDX?

MDX lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components and use them inline.

```js
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

Pretty cool, right?

### Testing Markdown Elements

Here's a paragraph with **bold text**, *italic text*, and ***bold italic text***. You can also use `inline code` within sentences.

#### Links

#### Lists

Unordered list:
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

Ordered list:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

#### Blockquote

#### Code Block with Syntax Highlighting

```typescript
interface Post {
  title: string;
  date: string;
  description: string;
}

const post: Post = {
  title: 'Hello World',
  date: '2024-01-01',
  description: 'My first blog post'
};
```

That's all for now!
